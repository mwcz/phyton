Phyton Installation
===================

Installation guide for Phyton.  Please note, this installation procedure is
hardly tested.  Be ready for a rocky road.

First, install the  `libjpeg-dev` package is also required, but not available
through PyPI.

    sudo apt-get install libjpeg-dev

Install all the required packages from PyPI.  Run this from the root directory
of the project:

    pip install -r REQUIREMENTS

Make a copy of `src/settings.py.sample`:

    cd src
    cp settings.py.sample settings.py

Then edit `settings.py` to customize Phyton to your liking.

Initialize the database.

    src/manage.py syncdb

See if it works:

    src/manage.py runserver
